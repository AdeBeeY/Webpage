This project was focused on creating a webpage from scratch.
Only HTML and CSS are used at the moment, and flexbox was
used all through.

The page is divided into 5(five) parts (footer inclusive) 
having pictures, links, buttons and the likes.

NOTE: This project has no connection of whatsoever with
bubblekidscompany but only decided to run the advert for
her as the company has beautiful dresses for kids.
